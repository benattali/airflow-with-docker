# An Apache-airflow example with docker

## To run this
- First make sure Python and Pip are installed
- I recommend creating a virtual environment in the root project and entering it
- Run `make local-build` to build docker images
- Run `make local-run` to run docker image instances
- If everything worked it should run on localhost:8080
- Run `make local-kill` to close all docker image instances
